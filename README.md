# Multi-Lingual-Excercises
This will provide a 5 language view of the same projects from 'Exercises for Programmers: 57 Challenges to Develop Your Coding Skills' by  Brian P. Hogan --- His book provides only the project language agnostic idea, all code is mine and all version are a continuous reiteration of the 57 exercises across 5 languages. Each will include a mission statement and all code in master will be fully functional to that mission/goal.
